# Wildlife-Tracker Java App

### By Ephantus Mwangi

## Description

    This application is used to track all the animals found in the zoo by rangers and keep track of them. This is accomplished by fiiling a table and submiting it.

   * A good example would be one like this, if a ranger find a snake he says which zone and the place it is and if it is weak or healthy
