# CeaserCipher Java App

### By Ephantus Mwangi

## Description

    In "cryptography", a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, which this Java App ustilises.
    It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
    For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

   * A good example would be one like this, it shifts letters by reverse shift of 3 letters

            Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
            Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

   * Deciphering is done  with a right shift of 3 letters.
